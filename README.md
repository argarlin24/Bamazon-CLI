# Bamazon-CLI

Welcome to Bamazon CLI!

With Bamazon CLI you can purchase products from a database that contains our current inventory. If you have Manager credentials you can have futher access to the database. 

To begin, there are two main commands:
* node bamazonCustomer.js 
* node bamazonManager.js 

bamazonCustomer.js:

If you follow the customer path you be shown the current inventory and asked what you would like to purchase and then given your total. 

bamazonManager.js

The manager will give you four options:

    1. View Current Inventory
    2. View Low Inventory
    3. Update Stock
    4. Add new Product

Each of these tasks will prompt the user and guide them through the process. 

* To end each action just ctrl + c
